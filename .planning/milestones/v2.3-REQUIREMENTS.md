# Requirements: Rondo Sync v2.3

**Defined:** 2026-02-06
**Core Value:** Keep downstream systems automatically in sync with Sportlink member data without manual intervention.

## v2.3 Requirements

### Birthday Sync Migration

- [x] **BDAY-01**: Sync birthdate as `acf.birthdate` field on person during existing Stadion person sync step

- [x] **BDAY-03**: Remove or deprecate the `stadion_important_dates` DB table
- [x] **BDAY-04**: Update email reports to remove the separate birthday sync section

## Out of Scope
