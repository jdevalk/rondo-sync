# Milestone v1.2: Email Improvements

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-25
**Phases:** 4
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Polish email reports with HTML formatting, proper sender name, and cleaner output. Also fix cron installer to overwrite existing entries.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Email Polish

**Goal**: Sync report emails are well-formatted HTML with proper sender identity and no noise.
**Depends on**: None (builds on v1.1 Postmark infrastructure)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - HTML email formatting with from name
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md - Clean output and cron overwrite fix

**Requirements:**
- EMAIL-06: Sync reports are sent as HTML email with proper formatting
- EMAIL-07: Email from name displays as "Sportlink SYNC"
- EMAIL-08: Email body does not include npm script execution header
- INST-01: Running install-cron replaces existing sportlink-sync cron entries

**Success Criteria:**
1. Running sync and sending email shows "Sportlink SYNC" as sender name in inbox
2. Email body is formatted HTML with headings/sections (not plain text dump)
3. Email does not contain "> sportlink-downloader@0.1.0 sync-all" npm header
4. Running install-cron twice results in exactly 2 cron entries (not 4)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use semantic HTML parsing instead of pre tag for email formatting
- Direct node invocation instead of npm run for clean cron output
- grep -v filter pattern for idempotent crontab installation

**Issues Resolved:**
- Email reports were plain text wrapped in pre tag (now semantic HTML)
- npm script header polluted email output
- Running install-cron multiple times created duplicate cron entries

**Issues Deferred:**
None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None
